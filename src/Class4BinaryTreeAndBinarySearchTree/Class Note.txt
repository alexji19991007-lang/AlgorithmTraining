Binary Tree
Definition: at most two children node.
Example:
                10
              /    \
            5       15
          /   \    /  \
         2     7  12   20  --> all leaf nodes' level = 3
        / \
    null   null

The height of above binary tree is 3.

基本知识点：
Binary tree traversal:
    DFS:
        a. Pre-order: 我把我⾃⼰放在最前来访问value...然后再左，右
            10 5 2 7 15 12 20
        b. In-order: 我先访问完左边所有的东西...然后再是自己的value...最后再右边
            2 5 7 10 12 15 20
        c. Post-order: 我先访问完左边所有的东西...然后再访问完右边所有东西...最后才是自己的value...
            2 7 5 12 10 15 20
    BFS:
        d. Level-order: 一层一层来
            10 5 15 2 7 12 20


See InOrderTraversal.java.

Height of binary tree:
The total number of nodes in the longest path from root node to leaf node.

Balanced Binary Tree: 
Is commonly defined as a binary tree in which the height of the left and right subtrees 
of EVERY NODE differ by 1 or less.

Balanced:
                10
              /    \
            5       15
          /   \    /  \
         2   null 12   null

Not Balanced:
                10
              /    \
            5       15
          /   \    /  \
         2   null 12   16
        /         / 
       6         17   

CONCLUSION 1: If a tree has n number of nodes., and it is balanced, then the height(level) of the tree = O(log_2(n))
IMPORTANT NOTE: If a tree has n number of nodes., but we don’t know if it is balanced, then the height(level) 
of the tree = O(n)

Complete binary tree: is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all 
nodes are as far left as possible

Complete:
                10
              /    \
            5       15
          /   \    /  \
         2    12  14   null

Not Complete:
                10
              /    \
            5       15
          /   \    /  \
         2   null 14   null


Not Complete:
                10
              /    \
            5       15
          /   \    /  \
         2    13  14  null
        /
       4

CONCLUSION 2: If a tree is a complete tree, then it must be a balanced tree.


Binary Search Tree: for every single node in the tree, the values in its left subtree are all smaller 
than its value, and the values in its right subtree are all larger than its value.

Example:
                10
              /    \
            5       12
          /   \    /  \
         2     7  11   13

CONCLUSION 3: If we print the value of the nodes in BST in in-order sequence, then it must form an ascending order.

Recursion在tree题⽬的基本应⽤⼤致分为2类⽤法
1. 把value从上往下传递 then 从下往上的题⽬
    1.1. BST 判定⽅法
2. 只把value 从下往上传递（更为常⻅，必须熟练掌握）
    2.1. getHeight(Node root) 是经典的把integer value从下往上传递的题⽬
    2.2. isBalanced(Node root) 是把boolean value从下往上传递的题⽬
    2.3. isSymmetric(Node root1, Node root2) 是把boolean value从下往上传递的题⽬
    2.4. Assign the value of each node to be the total number of nodes that belong to its left subtree. 
        (是把integer value从下往上传递的题⽬)
