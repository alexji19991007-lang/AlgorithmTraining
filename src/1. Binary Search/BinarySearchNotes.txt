1. Observations of Binary Search
    The size of search space ([L…M] or [M…R]) reduced roughly by one half of
    the previous iteration and eventually the search space is reduced to 2
    elements and to 1 element eventually
    1000 → 500 → 250 → 125 → … → 2 → 1
    log(n)

2. Principles of Binary Search
    1. We must guarantee that the search space decreases over time
        (after each iteration) --> do not cause infinite loop
    2. We must guarantee that the target (if exists) cannot be ruled
        out accidentally, when we change the value of Left or Right. (It is
        critical to define the rule about how to move the range for
        search)
